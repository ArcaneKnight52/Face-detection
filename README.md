# Face-detection
This project aims to detect human faces in an image or video using machine learning techniques. In this repository, you will find all the necessary code and resources needed to run the face detection algorithm on your own images or videos.

Getting started:
  -1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
  -2.Install the required dependencies listed in the "requirements.txt" file.
  -3.Create a "data" directory in the root directory and add your images or videos to it.
  -4.Run the "face_detection.py" script to perform face detection on the images or videos in the "data" directory.
  
  
How it works:
The face detection algorithm uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in an image or video frame. It uses a Haar Cascade classifier to identify the location of faces in the image. The classifier has been trained on thousands of positive and negative images to detect the unique features of a human face.

Output:
The algorithm generates an output image or video with bounding boxes around the detected faces. The bounding boxes indicate the location of the face in the image or video frame.
